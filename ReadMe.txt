## Routes Overview

### `routes`
This folder contains existing routes.  
**Note:** Ignore files here. Any changes should be done in `routesTwo`.

### `routesTwo`
This folder is for all new route creation, updates, or deletions.  
All your code changes should be made here, not in `routes`.

### `server.js`
Sections marked with comments should be ignored.  
You can add new code between comment sections, but focus on other parts of the file.

## Quick Summary
- Ignore `routes` folder.  
- Work only in `routesTwo`.  
- Ignore commented sections in `server.js`.
